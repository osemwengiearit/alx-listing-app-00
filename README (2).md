# alx-listing-app

This project aims to build a responsive and interactive listing page, designed as a clone inspired by popular platforms like Airbnb.

## Project Goal

The goal is to showcase modern front-end development practices, including efficient data display, user interface design, and state management, providing a robust foundation for a full-fledged listing application.

## Project Structure

This Next.js project is organized to promote modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Below is a brief explanation of the key directories:

- **`components/`**: This directory houses all reusable UI components, such as buttons, cards, navigation bars, or specific listing item displays. Breaking down the UI into smaller, independent components enhances reusability and simplifies development.

- **`interfaces/`**: This directory is dedicated to TypeScript interface and type definitions. It defines the shapes of data objects (e.g., `Listing`, `User`, `FilterOptions`), ensuring type safety across the application and making the codebase more predictable and easier to debug.

- **`constants/`**: This directory stores immutable data and configuration values that are used throughout the application. Examples include API endpoints, navigation links, default values, or magic strings, centralizing them for easy management and updates.

- **`public/assets/`**: This directory is for static assets that are served directly by Next.js. The `assets/` subdirectory specifically organizes images, fonts, icons, and other static files used in the application's UI, making them publicly accessible via a direct URL.
